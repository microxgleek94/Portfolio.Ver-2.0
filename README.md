# Portfolio.Ver-2.0

## Updated Portfolio

This updated version of my portfolio highlights some new concepts I have learned during for the last 3 months of my enrollement of Colmbia University's FullStack Coding BootCamp. I am halfway through the 6 month program, and so far I have learned about:

*HTML
*CSS
*Javascript
*JQuery
*Third-Party APIs

These concepts are higligted in my updated "Portfolio" HTML file, which now holds images and the deployed links of projects/assignments I've worked on during the course.
